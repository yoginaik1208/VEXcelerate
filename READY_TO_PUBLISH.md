## 📱 What You Need to Do Next

### **Option A: Publish Android (Easiest - Can Do Right Now!)**

Android can be built on **any computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Here's what to do:

1. **Install Android Studio**
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Takes about 10-15 minutes to install

2. **Run the build script**
   ```bash
   ./build-android.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Build your web app
   - Sync to Android
   - Open Android Studio automatically

3. **Generate Signed Bundle in Android Studio**
   - Wait for Gradle sync to finish
   - Go to `Build` → `Generate Signed Bundle / APK`
   - Choose `Android App Bundle`
   - Create new keystore (SAVE THIS FILE AND PASSWORD!)
   - Build release bundle

4. **Create Google Play Console Account**
   - Go to: https://play.google.com/console
   - Pay $25 one-time registration fee
   - Create new app listing

5. **Upload Your App**
   - Upload the `.aab` file from step 3
   - Fill in store listing (use STORE_LISTING.md)
   - Submit for review

**Timeline**: 1-2 days for Google approval

### **Option B: Publish iOS (Requires Mac)**

iOS publishing **requires a Mac** with Xcode. If you have a Mac:

1. **Transfer project to Mac**
   - Clone your GitHub repo on the Mac
   - Or transfer the entire project folder

2. **Install Xcode** (free from Mac App Store)

3. **Run the build script**
   ```bash
   ./build-ios.sh
   ```

4. **Configure in Xcode**
   - Select your Apple Developer Team
   - Archive the app
   - Upload to App Store Connect

5. **Create App Store Connect listing**
   - Go to: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
   - Fill in metadata (use STORE_LISTING.md)
   - Submit for review

**Cost**: $99/year Apple Developer Program
**Timeline**: 1-3 days for Apple review

### **Option C: Use Cloud Build Service (No Mac Needed!)**

If you don't have a Mac, use a cloud service to build iOS:

**Recommended Services:**
1. **EAS Build** (Expo) - Free tier available
   - https://expo.dev/eas
   
2. **Codemagic** - Free for personal projects
   - https://codemagic.io

3. **Bitrise** - Free tier available
   - https://www.bitrise.io

These services connect to your GitHub repo and build iOS/Android apps in the cloud!
